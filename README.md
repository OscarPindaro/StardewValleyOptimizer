# StardewValleyOptimizer
The idea behind this project is to find the best possible planning for the Game Stardew Valley. The tool considers every crop that can be planted and return a planting schedule for each crop. 
A schedule is composed of threee main parts: the crop type, the number of seeds that have to be planted, and the time of the year in which it should be planted.
The result of the schedul is optimal or neal optimal, since it uses techiniques of Integer Linear Programming.
The current script does not consider the availability of a greenhouse.
