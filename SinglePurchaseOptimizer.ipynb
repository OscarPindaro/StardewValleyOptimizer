    "In stardew valley, every plant can be bought in an emporium for a given cost. Every crop has a different price and different growing time. When a crop has completed its growing cycle, it can be harvested and sold, generating a revanue.<br>\n",
    "In this context, different resources must be considered.\n",
    "- *money* - Someone said somewhere:\n",
    "    >The person who doesn't know where his next dollar is coming from usually doesn't know where his last dollar went.\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    Of course money is a resource. We have little money, and we want to make a lot of money. The game starts with a very very small amount, and it's our duty to harvest it and become richer and richer (and marry Leah).\n",
    "    \n",
    "- *space* - The space that we have at our disposal in the farm it's not infinite. Every crop will use one tile, and sometimes this space must be sacrified for other objects like scarerows or splinkers. Sadly, every penny in the world is not enough when no space can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *time* - I imagine that somewhere in the internet there's another good quote, but i'm too lazy. In Stardew Calley, time is essential, since every crop needs several days to complete its growth cycle. However, there is another limitation. The year is divided in 4 months of 28 days, one for each season. Every season has a set of allowed plants that can grow; if a green cabbage plant lasts till the end of the spring, it will be atrociously killed by the mighty spears of the summer Sun.\n"
